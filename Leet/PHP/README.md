# How to run
1. Install php.
2. `php <path/to/file>`
## Notes
Php syntax is very annoying for quickly doing algorithms. Having to put $ sign before every variable and having a function for everything from getting the length of a string to pushing to an array makes it less than ideal for a coding interview.
